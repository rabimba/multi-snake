## Multi-Snake
### This is a prototype of what I think would be an ideal Multiplayer Snake Game. Based on HTML5 and web-sockets.

This is still WIP and highly experimental.
Youcan use the js to actually create the game and when more than one player approaches it should be automatically able to detect and put them in game. 
But as I said it is still work in progress.

I live demo would be coming soon as soon as I get to figure out a few glitches.

- It is based on websockets. Would try to make a nodejs version when I get enough hands on with it.
- As you have guessed already you need a HTML5 browser to play it so anything below IE9 is a strictly NO NO.
- Till now it uses a bit of CPU. Trying to optimize that
